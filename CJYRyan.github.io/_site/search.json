On this website, I offer a glimpse into my world, the exploration of the arts, architecture and projects that I am learning.\nMy interest in new media and learning more about the online world, comes from my journey with design. My journey with design has just began and I would like to explore and showcase as much as I can. I would like to influence and infuse my design with art to show a side that is unique to myself. My strength in art lies in oil painting, I have been painting for 4 years and I was awarded “highly commended” and shortlisted for UOB painting of the year 2008 and 2023 respectively.\nMy journey in design started in architecture school and it has impacted the way I view the world. Architecture is not only about buildings, but it is also about the people who inhabit these buildings.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my artworks, architecture projects and design works. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work.Please feel free to contact me if you have any commissions or enquirers on projects.\n\nInstagram"

Here, the water takes on whatever shapes the bottles hold, a representation of one’s search for identity while growing up, attempting to fit into the different moulds and forms as dictated by societal norms. With the labels of the bottles peeled off, the artist is also suggesting that the search for identity is an endless and uncertain one. The bottles are leaning against one another precariously, highlighting the tension and struggle people go through during this search."

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth’s history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

Abstracting the familiar plastic into something visually captivating by contrasting black and white with the flamboyant iridescent plastic. Viewers get lost in the details as they look through the drawing and start to wonder what they are looking at. Queery seeks to be questioned, what is the artist drawing and why did the artist draw this. I would like people to ask questions and get to know more about the art as well as the LGBTQ community.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

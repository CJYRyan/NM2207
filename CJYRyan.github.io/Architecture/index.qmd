“Living With A Memory” explores the idea of intangible qualities. What are
some ways in which architecture can foster a sense of curiosity and awe ?
To explore these ideas, I studied physical qualities on site that could create
fleeting moments that would help create and allude to the idea of memory.
Making use of the trees and street lamps on site. The experience of the
building changes throughout the day and night, as sunlight passes through the
trees, the filigree of trees can be seen on the ground and wall. As night falls
the street lamps cast shadows in the alley and the building lights up like a jem.

"Peek-A-Boo" was inspired by Chungking Express a film that captured lovers in a fragmented world. Through sections and exploration of aggregated form the collective building displays public and private interactions between users.
